To use these mods on a Wii U, you need the [CodePatchPlugin](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/CodePatchPlugin) and the Aroma environment installed. Follow the instructions in that repo to ensure everything gets put in the correct folders. Technically, they should also work with CafeLoader via Haxchi/Tiramisu, but you can only use one mod at a time this way.

To use these mods with Cemu, copy the contents of the ```Cemu``` folder to the appropriate folder in your ```graphicPacks```.

## Freecam

The Freecam has only been tested with a Wii U gamepad (or emulated gamepad). Pro controller support may be limited. Controls are as follows:
```
Hold R to increase camera speed
Hold L to decrease camera speed
ZR to move camera up
ZL to move camera down
Right stick to control field of view
Left stick to control horizontal camera position
Left stick button to toggle free camera
```
